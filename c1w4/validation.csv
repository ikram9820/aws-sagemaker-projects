__label__-1 "this dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out . however the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers . i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big . the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short . while the design is beautiful there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling . for reference i am 24 waist"

__label__1 "ok so this is adorable . i am 5 ' 3 and medium size and had to take this to my alterations people because i loved it so much but it fit awkwardly . the back was too long and hung funny on my short body . after it was reworked it is the cutest thing i own . they also made the little belt tighter across my waist . it is super versatile . my alterations people ran out and bought themselves one after they saw mine . so -- -- if you are not a toothpick or tall know it can be amazing with a little attention ."
__label__-1 "i love ( d ) this top . it was my go to top even in the heat the fabric is light and breathes . however pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body . it could not be repaired . i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it ."
__label__0 "the pattern of this skirt is adorable and looks better in person but the fabric isnt the best . it feels like an elastic fabric and is way to volumous . overall not my favorite ."
__label__1 "purchased this top at my local store and it is very flattering ! not to boxy hits at the hip and drapes nice . great for work or with jeans . i purchase the navy faux fur scarf to wear around the neck and wow !"
__label__-1 "love the softness and the length . the color was perfect . but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body . the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections . will be returning the sweater ."
__label__1 "i was in love with this top from the moment i put it on . it is of high quality with layers to ensure the top is n't sheer . the embroidery is so pretty and the top looks way less grandma in person . i ordered the petite xxs and it fits perfectly . i really appreciate that the underarm holes are just the right size and do n't show off any of my bra which sometimes happens with sleeveless tops . i can wear it with jeans and boots or with a pencil skirt and heels and it looks great with both outfits . o"

__label__1 "this dress is easy to wear lined and feels like it could be a wonderful summer staple . i love that it 's so colorful . but for some reason the pops of color on the white background did not look great on my very pale skin . i 'm sure on someone else this will be beautiful . i also thought it ran just slightly large in the bust ( although to be fair i am small-chested ) ."

__label__0 "tried this on in the store - i love the colors but the cut was just not flattering . the liner was fine but the dress flared out excessively and looked like a tent . tried it with a belt for some definition but the fabric was too thick ."
__label__1 "love this shirt ! i have it in both colors . you can wear it off the shoulder or on . it 's baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough you could n't see i had drains underneath my tank top . i am really grateful for this shirt ! super soft super cute !"
__label__1 "nice top . armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman i 'm picky about that . the print is pretty and unusual . it just did n't look great on me . there 's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely . it 's a lightweight tee fabric that 's opaque . i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible . great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down . i do recommend ."
__label__0 "i practically live in lounge pants and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version . i 'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well if a bit big . the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets . the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs . the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness . as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown definitely not"

__label__0 "i ordered this dress after seeing it styled with a beautiful cape . when it arrived it was incredibly soft and the color was a pretty muted pink . however once i put it on it clinged to all the wrong places . having a larger chest made it show a lot of cleavage and if i ca n't wear a standard bra with it it 's too complicated . in a regular tank dress it would have been a yes . overall a great dress but probably for another body type ."
__label__1 "as all the reviews say it is completely sheer . it 's a very cute top other than that ."
__label__1 "this top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased . i really love it . it is different than i thought it would be . i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow . definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large . definitely recommend ."
__label__-1 "i loved the design and look to this shirt but it ran way big for me . i loved the forgiving fit but it just was n't flattering at all . i even went down one size and it still was huge . sad to send this one back ."

__label__-1 "as another reviewer pointed out although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water the color around the popsicles will bleed ! this is extremely disappointing . i 'm hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover or that retailer will take this item back . would only dry clean this item ."
__label__0 "this suit itself is adorable . i usually have to get a size large for length but in this case the cups are way too big . it says light padding but there is no padding . just a giant empty cup . i 'm going to order the size medium ."
__label__0 "i tried this dress on in the store prepared to buy this lovely piece . i feel that it should have been a few inches longer it would look more proportionate . next the tie is really difficult to place but it creates some great detail to the front and back . it wrinkles easily i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear . lastly it is not lined what a bummer at least the skirt could be lined . but it does have pockets that is sweet ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this coat so bad . the material is lovely and it 's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off . if you have any hips forget it ( my hips are 38 ) - you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy . the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders .... like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted it was weird . but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it was n't a size thing . i bought a size medium at 5 ' 5 and 140 pounds ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this . i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock . i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer . unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange . it cut my off in the most unflattering spot ."
__label__1 "if you love the boho style then this too is for you . it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans leggings sandals boots and booties . i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall . it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws . for reference i 'm 5 ' 3 and bought the pm but needed the ps . i have recievied tons of compliments and i 'm thinking of getting the silver one too !"
__label__-1 "i ordered a small but it was way to big . it was very soft ."
__label__-1 "i love jumpsuits - except for this one . the fabric is blah . it 's between plastic and the material that they make flags out of . the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute . the tie thing that 's just hanging there ? it 's a tie thing that just hangs there . it does n't look good hanging and it does n't look good tied . this jumpsuit had so much potential . i 'm definitely disappointed . for sizing reference i am 5 ' 5 135 34c and a small was perfect ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited for this dress .. but sadly it did not meet expectations . the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it . the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere . ( i 'm 5 ' 7 ) i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l .. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top . also i like to have the first button open but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey . it 's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding"

__label__-1 "received this in the mail today and was disappointed . i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all . the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body . needless to say i will be returning this item"
__label__-1 "this is one fabulous-looking dress ; however the really scratchy neckline at the lace edge was a deal-breaker for me . i even tried sizing up to see if that would help but it was still too scratchy for me ."
__label__0 "this top may be right for some but it did not work for me . i 've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one . however it did n't do much to flatter my body . i ordered the xl but it was huge . i 'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available . i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big . the quality is great and style so pretty though . i wish it had worked for me !"
__label__-1 "this white shirt is very thin esp in the front and see through - i would have to wear a cami underneath unless i wanted people to see the outline of my bra . it seems very flimsy and poor quality even at the sale price . disappointed and will return ..."
__label__0 "like the previous reviewer the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is . i 'm 5 ' 4 and ordered a 12 which is usually what i wear at retailer . even only being 5 ' 4 this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated . it fits everywhere else though . i 'm obsessed with the back so i 'm going to keep it and wear it . i 'd say it 's worth it at the sale price ."
__label__0 "it was cute . i did n't keep it because it was n't soft and hung a bit different than pictured . i thought it would be softer material . it was itchy"
__label__0 "the fit is a bit loose in the body ( more than you can tell on the model ) - more like a true swing style top . i feel the arms are a good fit but i ordered one size up from my normal since i 'm planning to wear this as a maternity top . arms are definitely a size smaller than the body . the ruffles at the bottom are a bit odd but overall i still like it . the cutout notch at the collar is super cute ! plus the green color of this top is lovely and i love that it 's made in the usa so i 'll be keeping"
__label__1 "i tried this shirt and really loved the feel and the scalloped sleeves . i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery and i always find myself drawn to their clothing . the fit was n't too boxy on me but i 'm between m & l and sized down so that might have helped . if i did n't have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up !"
__label__1 "this tank/blouse is flowy and i love the design . it was immediately comfortable and seemed true to size . i wore it to a family event with a sweater black leggings and boots . i 'm 5 ' 5 36d and usually wear medium in retailer tops and this fit beautifully from the get go just love it !"

__label__-1 "much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo . when i pulled it out of the package i thought i 'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow . but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly with beautiful detail and high quality material but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape . it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion . it does n't look anything like the phot"
__label__-1 "i really liked the style and fit of this shirt but i 'm giving it a 2 because i shirt should last longer than 6 months . i 've taken it to the cleaners 2 times and the fabric behind the tag beneath the collar has fallen apart and there are holes ."
__label__1 "i love this skirt . i usually do n't buy skirts of this cut because they make me look hippy . but the fabric is so lightweight and flowing and yet it has structure . the colors are great and go with many top options . i wear it to work and casual outings . it is my favorite clothing article in my closet right now ."
__label__0 "i am very into the lace tops ! purchased this but it 's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5 ' 3 it feels almost like a tunic . lots of extra material in the back . love the look and if you 're tall enough it should work for you !"
__label__1 "i never buy shorter shorts my legs are so muscular that most are unflattering but these were actually ok. they did n't look loose like the model but hit a nice spot on the leg and they have enough stretch to fit me nicely . i even bought the white color ... unheard of ! i weigh 115 lbs all legs ..."

__label__1 "i love this dress . i read the reviews on it before i purchased and they were spot on . i have broad shoulders so i ordered the large . it was still plenty roomy but i wore a royal blue sweater with it and it pulled the waist in just enough to make it fit without a belt . i would buy it again ! !"
__label__0 "the skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach . you ca n't really tell from the pic . but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut . i 'm pretty slim - 5 ' 5 '' and 114 pounds and it was n't doing me any favors ! the top of the dress is beautiful ! i will exchange it for something else . i ordered it online and could n't try it on before purchasing it ."
__label__0 "this dress is very pretty in person . it fits true to size and is very figure flattering . one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage . my only gripe with this dress is that it 's a little rough and stiff feeling . i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft . it probably works for most people but not for me so had to go back ."
__label__1 "snap this one up but make sure you order a size larger than your normal size . it runs a full size too small . it sold out before and i was told it was n't coming back in . i had purchased one previously in my regular size but it was too small . to my delight it 's back and i 've purchased one in the next size up . it 's well made can go from business to sport to casual ."

__label__1 "as in most ribbed camis this stretches out - so size down . it is very pretty/delicate ( e.g . fabric is thin ) and the silver/grey color has metalic thread running through . plan to pair it with an retailer grey bolero sweater for the holidays ."
__label__0 "this top is very nice . i ordered it in black it looked very good . the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look . the fabric however feels like heavy cotton . it did n't feel very soft and comfortable it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton . while i think this will retain it 's shape and not stretch like softer cotton i am sending it back . it felt a bit heavy to wear ."
__label__-1 "it was very pretty but it ran very big sadly i had to return it ."
__label__-1 "oh what a disappointment ! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan . the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam . so back it goes . and i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $ 60 for this top !"
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this sweater . the color is gorgeous the pattern unusual it is soft and warm and would have gone with so many things . but the cut is awful . mainly the sleeves are way too big making me look misshapen and my arms look huge . the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal . too bad ."

__label__0 "liked the netting around the collar but the whole blouse was very baggy . order size down ."
__label__1 "i love this sweatshirt . it 's super chic and sexy ( and for those of us that need actual support it looks great with a strappy sports bra ) . that said selling this as one size fits all is misleading at best . i 'm 5 ' 2 ~160 ( a lot of it muscle but i enjoy chorizo ) a 34ddd and this fit me perfectly but i ca n't imagine it would work for anyone much larger than a size 12. just be real -- this is a smedium . one star removed for the one size fits all fallacy ."

__label__-1 "then this one is for you ! so disappointed upon receipt of this skirt as i had been eyeing it for a while and was excited to see it on sale . based upon the pictures i thought the black stitching was just an interesting outline detail but it is actually masking this skirt 's ugly secret : a pouch . yes it literally has a pouch smack dab in the middle of your abdomen which does not lay flat . the material also looks rather snag prone and already had a few pulls in spots . this one"

__label__0 "i 'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve . the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve but the sleeves do not fit loosely they kind of twist under the armpit area . i do not have large arms so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves but they do not fit right . i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline . it is messy and tacky looking but i think that is how it was meant to be . my recommendation to buy"
__label__0 "so i have n't actually tried this and i 'm sorry for the misleading star rating . i just wanted to get someone 's attention on the length . the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video the dress is about 2 inches off the floor . is it the model in the video that is extra tall ? someone help me out . this looks gorgeous but since it 's an online exclusive i wo n't be able to try it on at the store ."

__label__0 "i love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso . when i raised my arms up it bunched up all wrong because it 's a very thick sweater ."
__label__1 "this top is so flowy and has a great fit ! i can see wearing it lots of different ways . it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down ."
__label__0 "i do not love these pants . while the fabric is nice they make me look rather dumpy . i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender . these pants make me look like i 've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat . perhaps they would look good on someone tall but at 5 ' 6 these are a miss for me !"

__label__-1 "well i wanted to love it and it was just too much . i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be . i also feel it should be fully lined . it was not . the exterior wool and pattern is very nice . maybe if it was lined a smaller size would have worked better but for the price i needed more . i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up . i realize this is n't in the picture so no expectation but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines"

__label__0 "this is a beautiful lined jacket with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono . it hit me at the high hip not low hip as shown on the model . given how structured it is i do n't think the one size will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit ."
__label__0 "this jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short . i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket . the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types . the arms were definitely too short ."
__label__1 "these chinos fit great ! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear . i bought all 3 colors !"

__label__-1 "tried this on at my local retailer the red color is pretty but not a true red . the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days . two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it opening up to the world ! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra this is a deal-breaker for me it ca n't be fixed ."
__label__-1 "i have several maeve dresses that fit really well . this was not the case with this dress . fabric and color are great ! fit was off especially in top . worst part was zipper that would n't move smoothly . took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped . such a bummer !"
__label__1 "i recently bought this blouse the soft fabric drapes nicely and the stitching is wonderful . love it !"
__label__0 "i 'm surprised this worked for so many people . for me this dress fit terribly . however the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made . i am 5 ' 3 and about 117 with a really short torso and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have . i think the bodice was just too long for me . the neckline was also too low . on someone taller or maybe with a longer torso i could see this dress being really lovely ."
__label__1 "i have never looked good in a legging . stretchy denim jeggings are usually the most i can get away with . but i am amazed how flattering these are ! the fit is great ( i got a m cause i 'm small but curvy in my hips/butt ) the material is thick enough not to reveal too much and the faux pocket in the back does a lot to make one feel less exposed . the length seems like it would be a great compromise between short and tall girls too -- i 'm pretty short but they are n't too long on me there 's a ve"

__label__1 "i tried this on at the suggestion of one of the sales girls . i was skeptical of the simple shape but when i put on the green one i did n't want to take it off-ever . i am 6 ' and thin- the small fits me perfectly . i loved it so much i purchased the blue as well . love love love !"
__label__1 "super comfortable top . easily washable 2 options with the sleeves and a nice drape to the fabric . truly a go-anywhere top ."

__label__0 "this sweater runs true to size . i am 5 ' 7 ' and 125 lbs and ordered the small . it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle . it is a well made heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm . if you like the feel of wool buy it . if not pass on it ."
__label__0 "the dress is nice but i was not excited about the color . the only color is this blue . also everyone has their favorite fit . i think i like some other fit better . my biggest problems are color and that is made majorly from synthetic materials . otherwise it fits well and for the right body type it will be perfect fit . i like to own dresses made of more natural materials ."
__label__-1 "so i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point ( and intent ) at retailer so i had hopes . i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days but it 's honestly so thin i could n't even see it working that well for that . it 's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model ; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti"
__label__0 "i purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding . i loved the color the fit and the style . i even got a lot of compliments on it . the problem was that the wedding was on the beach in florida 85 degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal ! unfortunately i had to return it . would be great to wear indoors just watch getting water or anything else on it !"
__label__-1 "i loved this romper so much ! the material is thin but perfect for summer . the style is just what i was looking for . it 's so so cute and fit perfectly ... at first . i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition . it went from loose and flowy like on the model to little booty shorts and a body suit ... not the look i was going for . i am so disappointed ."
__label__1 "i paid full price for this cardigan and have not regretted purchase for one minute having worn it almost every day this summer . it is the perfect weight for cool summer evenings seaside strolls chilly restaurants or for a sunblock layer when you have to be outside ."
__label__0 "this dress is very pretty colorwise but the fit did not work for me . i could see this working on girls with narrow hips but it did n't flatter my narrow waist/wide hip frame ."
__label__1 "great skirt can be dressy work or casual love it !"
__label__0 "bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost . fabric feels cheap like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly . did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack . gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag . returned it ."
__label__0 "i ordered this to arrive at my store and was so excited to try it on . it was soft and cuddly but a little baggy under the arms and it shed everywhere . underwhelmed ."
__label__0 "just received two the red and the black . the black is a great print very versatile . both run large but the black most significantly so . the red is close enough to fitting to keep . the black shows my bra b/c it is so large and the armholes cut far too deeply . ( the red also shows a fair amount of the armpit area but ( barely ) covers my bra . the material is somewhat thinner than expected but not so sheer that a skin-toned bra would n't be sufficient ."
__label__-1 "this is an extremely flattering dress . i could n't resist buying it even though i did n't come into the store looking for a dressier dress which i feel this is . once i tried it on i had to purchase it . its one of those things that i know i wo n't regret because at some point an occasion will show up that i 'll wear it to . its soft comfy and flowing and accentuates the body 's curves without being too tight or clingy . its a classic !"
__label__-1 "this dress is super bulky and unflattering . the knit is loose and see-through . looks like it was knitted by a five-year old . if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you . back to the store it goes"
__label__-1 "thought this would be a great dress for warm days but alas it fit like a sack . love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses . shame this did nothing for my curves . ordered an 8 usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders . if you can sport a loose swingy shape this is a great dress with nice detailing but sadly the shape did not work for me ."
__label__-1 "this item is pretty the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents . my issue with it is it 's very impractical . the fabric is extremely thin and you would n't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees . it 's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season . the tube top underneath does n't work very hard to stay up and is n't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit ( why wouldnt they just stitch a lining"

__label__0 "this vest looked so cute online . what you ca n't see however is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe ( about 3 wide ) . that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it did n't lay nicely . also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it 's lined with . fits true to size . i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the"

__label__0 "i was so excited to find this dress in the store ! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on .... what a disappointment . the fabric is stunning but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium so i grabbed a small ...... the only way to describe this dress is tentlike ! it was huge from the waist down . i do n't think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect ! i was sad to leave the store without this dress ."
__label__0 "the fabric is nice and could pass for silk even though it is viscose-rayon . the pattern is pretty and flattering . sadly the fit was just off- big in the center but tight at the hips . if i size up the v-neck might be too wide . i 'm disappointed that i 'll have to return it . it probably would look great on a different body type . i would recommend it for apple body types but not for pear body types ."
__label__1 "cozy soft fabric . love the snails on the pockets and the cute buttons . size down if you want a more tailored fit ."
__label__-1 "perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts or the cut of this was not right for me but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders did n't lay right on me . sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned . i am 5 ' 5 135lbs 34c curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small ."

__label__-1 "i looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money . i wear a size 2p . was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress . for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up . the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on -- - thick and heavy . the overall fit was too big and very unflattering ."
__label__0 "this sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy . the fit is larger around the arms and chest which might work well for people who are very curvy on top . it seems to taper a bit to the waist . the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape . it was too overwhelming on my petite frame what with the bold flower and the fit so i passed . but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater this could work well for you ."

__label__0 "i typically wear a 4/6 but am a little bigger right now so i went with the medium . was so excited to get these but was very disappointed when i tried them on . they look beautiful but there is no lining leaving the fabric uncomfortable . they were also huge ! definitely make sure you size down if you d"

__label__1 "i could live in this top : it 's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer ; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything ; and it 's comfortable enough to wear around the clock . note that it runs small . i had to size up to a medium even though 80 % of everything else i wear is size small ."
__label__0 "i ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer 's comment that they were unflattering on the back side . they really do hug your bum but that is not what bothers me . what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top they are not wearable in public or around other people . i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer but also some of the most poorly designed . unfortunately these fall in the latter category ."
__label__-1 "the dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling . the fabric will only get worse with wear . return . cute concept ; poor fabric quality ."

__label__0 "this blouse is super cute but oddly sized . i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust . the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage so this had to go back . i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer i just could n't make it work ."
__label__-1 "this dress looks great online with boots as shown . when it arrived and i tried it on it fit great on my arms was n't too tight on my neck but once it went down over my chest ( 36c ) the dress never came back in to show my feminine waist/shape . it just looked like a big trash bag on me very disappointing ! similar to a mumu ."
__label__0 "love this but the one thing that made me buy this is that if you look at the pic the girl has her hand in a pocket - there is no pocket ! ! ! which makes me bring the rating down - some one else had noted that the v is deep - they are very right - be prepared to shift the shirt lots unless you wear something under ....... it is- other than that i really like it"
__label__-1 "i just ca n't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo . mine has dark colors really dark colors . this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide . i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large . i liked the length and the fact that it 's shorter than shown . it still covered my bum . the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back . i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t"
__label__0 "the shorts are very cute very nice quality and intricate detailing ! the sizing is tight in waist and very big in legs not flattering at all . i 'm 5 ' 1 115 lbs . they are going back ."
__label__1 "really like this tunic a lot . it is comfortable and easy to throw on and look put together . i 'm always a fan of pockets too ! i ordered the xs -- i 'm 5 ' 4 about 118 # . it fits loose but not in a bad way . the fabric allows it to fall well over the body . if you are tall it will probably be too short for you as it was a few inches above my knees . glad to have snagged this right away ! more tunics like this please !"
__label__1 "i love this shirt . the colors are just as depicted . the material is gorgeous and the top is very flattering . fits true to size for retailer small ( i 'm normally a medium outside of this store ) ."
__label__0 "this is a beautiful dress . the lace top is stunning ! the fit is true to size and there 's no stretch . i had the same problem as other reviewers ... that darn zipper . it 's so small and gets hung up easily . i could see it eventually failing in the future ."
__label__0 "unfortunately i had to size down twice with there pants . great feel they 're soft and the grey is a soft color ."
__label__0 "this dress has so much potential- loved the pattern and the neckline . however only one side of the waist was gathered with a fake sash leaving the other side plain . the gathered side was super flattering while the other side showed any little lump or bump . needless to say i 'm returning it ."
__label__0 "so disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size ! ! i ordered the 10 ( i 'm usually an 8 but that was sold out ) and the suit arrives and does n't even fir over my hips . -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6 ! gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue . the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for ."
__label__1 "this arrived today and i am thrilled with it . the material is soft but not at all clingy . it drapes perfectly falling just above the knee . there is a matching slip that is as nicely made as the dress itself . what a find !"
__label__1 "this fit me perfectly with a little room but think it 's meant to be this way so easier to get on and off . this feels like a dream and is very good quality . definitely a heavier piece but i like that . it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy . the back is adorable too ! retailer hit it out of park with this one ! grab it before it 's too late ! i 'm a 36ddd and size 14 and the large fit perfectly"
__label__0 "i knew i would love this dress it looked so me ! my order arrived and sadly to say it looks awful i was expecting 3/4 sleeves these were to the bottom of my wrist . i could have been fine with that but the entire dress was so big on me . it looked like a sack . i usually wear a sz 4 or s/m this was a small . will return . if you can find one that fits i would recommend it ."
__label__-1 "awful color horribly wrinkled and just a mess ... so disappointed"
__label__1 "i love this jacket . let 's be clear though ... it 's not for warmth just for style but it 's perfect for fall in california . i love the detailed work and have already tried this with so many different layers a light blue tank off white shirt tshirt and it looks great with lots of things and truly makes the outfit . love unique pieces like this and i will be wearing it often . i bought my usual size small . sleeves are a bit long for my 5 ' 4 frame but they did n't have in petite and it looks great ."
__label__0 "i am so sad that this romper did n't work out . it 's just way too billowy and huge . i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small . i 'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper ! might look best on taller girls . i am 5 ' 2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent . do not recommend . such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews !"
__label__1 "such great detail great beautiful in red and white ."
__label__0 "i really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy . it 's shorter in the front and longer in the back . the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled . it 's definitely worth trying on but did n't fit me ."
__label__1 "i love this dress it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me . i am not the tallest person 5 ' 4 but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing . perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast . it 's just something to be aware of . i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess ."
__label__-1 "i loved the look of this dress online so i was excited to order it but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be . i thought the material would be more lacy but it seemed pretty cheap . there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory but it made the material poof out just under the waist making me look like i had a belly . no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat . returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead which"
__label__0 "not for the curvy women . fit in the waist but bunched around the crotch"
__label__-1 "i am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss . it is too boxy ( short ) and the material is very thin for the price . i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer . for reference i am 5 ' 4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small . bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress . the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy . it is n't it is very heavy much too heavy for florida heat . the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down . i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance easily . back it went boo hoo . if you are between sizes i would size down runs a bit big ."
__label__0 "like others i was drawn to the collar fabric and overall look to it .... ________ pros : - thicker fabric so it hides lumps and bumps well . - collar is so classy but i am drawn to anything with a collar . - pockets are a nice touch . _______ cons : - thicker fabric and polyester = got hot rather quickly in it . - runs a tad small if you have hips . there was only a medium at the store to try on and it fit everywhere but the hips ; it just did n't flare out much for me being hourglass . a large"
__label__1 "i fell in love with this on-line and when it arrived today i think i love it even more because the white portion of this sweater is really a medium pink color which looks so chic . although i am not usually into pink this looks so stylish with the pink instead of the white . this is a piece you might find in a vintage store in the village in nyc . ca n't wait for it to get chilly so i can wear it . for reference i am 5 ' 1 36c chest and the small fit perfect . the quality is really high end as well ."
__label__1 "comfortable flattering one step up in formality from jammies what more could you want ?"
__label__1 "these are the best leggings ! they were so comfortable that i wore them all day and then to bed ; i did n't want to take them off . i 'm hoping to get a few more pairs ."
__label__-1 "i loved this top online and even more when i opened it up . however the quality of the stitching is poor . where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone . i was bummed and am sending it back today ."
__label__-1 "really cute sweater well made but so intensely itchy i could n't keep it on for more than 30 seconds !"
__label__0 "i do think this blazer is comfortable and looks decently cute but was n't sure about the fabric . hte coloring is fun too . i decided to pass on it only because of the previous review regarding shedding ."
__label__1 "i love camisoles like this and retailer always has great ones ! it has a nice length so the lace detail can show underneath a jacket or shorter cardigan . it 's fitted but not tight ."
__label__-1 "i love this jump suit .. sorta . looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin . i washed it and its still happening . when you put your hand in your pockets they come out blue knees are blue thighs etc . i looked dirty by the end of the day . wish i could return it . fit and look great ... not great after wear ."
__label__0 "i wanted to own this so badly ! it ran really short even with the adjustable slip and was incredibly tight in the shoulders . i could barely get the dress off !"
__label__-1 "review title says almost all . add to that that it is age appropriate unlike other kedia dresses for the very young . just too cute for words . i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart . this however on an older woman looks ridiculous . i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets !"
__label__1 "i tried this dress on in-store and fell in love with it as soon as i put it on . it 's beautifully made the fabric is soft comfortable and free-moving and overall it has a lovely vintage romantic look . i actually ended up wearing it for a family photo shoot the next week and was pleased with how it looked in our photos as well especially the lovely way the fabric draped . another reviewer said it seemed baggy and oddly-shaped ; it does seem shapeless before you tie the waist tie but once tha"

__label__1 "loved this cute dress . so easy and simple to wear . i wore it with tan/nude sandals to keep it casual for the race track in saratoga . so comfortable . for this price it is a must have ."
__label__-1 "the yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics . fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning ."
__label__-1 "completely oversized top size medium was swimming on me ..... boxy baggy shapeless -- what more can i say ? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo returned ."
__label__0 "sheer and lightweight . perfect for summer . great detail could not justify paying full price ."
__label__0 "this top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly . it still fits but something to be aware of ."
__label__-1 "this looks cute in the web photo unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person . i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me ."
__label__1 "beautiful color and super comfy . it runs large but the gathers still allow for it to have shape on the top ."
__label__-1 "i was bummed about this top . detail on back is pretty even so not worth it . i 'm usually an xs i 'm 120 lbs and it fit true to size . guess i had higher expectations . i 'm feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person ..."
__label__1 "i knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable beautiful fabric cute gold buttons ! as well due to the cut it feels roomy but has a slender fit around the arms . the denim color has beautiful detail but i do n't think i would like the maroon solid . i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one !"
__label__1 "i love every other byron lars dress i 've bought and this was a no brainer for me . when it arrived i was really disappointed . the fabric is very stretchy which makes it super forgiving and very thick . with all the buttons planted on this dress i was expecting it to open easily from the front as one of my other dresses by his does . nope . only the back buttons open . thick stretchy fabric and back buttons ... not an easy thing to navigate . i was also very sad to see that the length was all wrong for m"
__label__1 "the pictures of this sweater do not do it justice . i would have passed it over online but it immediately caught my eye in the store . the yarn is soft and cozy and the flair at the bottom adds a feminine touch . zipper is cute . v-neck is just right - it is not too low . i know i will be wearing this sweater a lot - very happy with this purchase ! i did n't see the pink or navy in the store ."
__label__0 "i was so excited when i saw this dress ! i love this color and the poplin sleeves . i was so sad when i tried it on though the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way . i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips . strange . also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality . i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top"
__label__1 "love this crinkle cotton top for spring . the print is great and i ca n't wait to wear it !"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer . but it 's almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short . the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically . had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve ."
__label__0 "beautiful top the silk was good quality not thin . ordered a 6 because it was selling out so quickly wished i could have ordered the 4. will definitely try if they come back in stock ."
__label__-1 "the shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering . the back felt bulky and looked awkward . definitely returning ."
__label__-1 "the sweater was nice but not as long as on the model . it was itchy also . this sweater was not what i had expected . their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash sorry retailer . i sent it back ."
__label__1 "this sweater is so soft and comfortable . looks dressy with skirt and booties or casual with leggings and flats ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in a l online and was n't a fan when i received it . the colors are pretty bright but they also look cheap in my opinion . it also had an awkward fit because of the material there is no give at all it was really tight on my chest ( 36d ) for reference . and it was also pretty short and i 'm short ! it barely hit the top of my pants ... and i 'm 5 ' 2 ! back it went ."

__label__0 "i bought this sweater online as soon as i saw it . but like the other reviewers i agree it is shapeless and sticks out too much at and below the waist . if it were a softer fabric maybe the flair would work but not for this one . i am 5 ' 2 115lbs 32d and got the xs . maybe if you are n't chesty it wo n't flare out as much . sadly i had to return it . i was so excited for it o well ."
__label__0 "this is really cute online but is not fantastic on or in person . this is a top that i may be returning . i love the open shoulder but the material is very thin and the top runs large . it also hangs really low in the back which i am not a huge fan of ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this shirt . the fit was great and the fabric just felt beautiful . luxurious soft and flowing . but the collar was frayed ... in addition the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship . i put it aside to return it then this morning went to have another look at it wanting to talk myself back into it . but i ca n't overlook the fact i 'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn . it may be only this"
__label__-1 "according to the label this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned . i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered . it looks like there 's a drawstring running through every seam . so disappointed in the quality and the labeling . awful ! i gave it one extra star because it 's cute ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward . it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back . i am going to return this item ."
__label__0 "this sweater is incredibly soft and pretty but there is just no way to get it to lay the way the model does in the picture . i found myself constantly tugging at the top to get it to stay off the shoulder - otherwise it just bunched up top and make a weird funnel neck . i really wanted it to work but it was just so impractical ."
__label__-1 "the design and quality were great . i really wanted them to fit but they ran large . i 'm 5 ' 4 and 120 lbs and orderd the small . unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i wo n't be trying a size down . the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward . sadly these went back ."
__label__-1 "i was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress . this was not it . completely see through . i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up . but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip . its an odd design . absolutely not worth the price . i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress . returned this piece without looking back"
__label__0 "i am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and yikes right out of the package knew they '' d be way to small . they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful . i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for . i 'll update this review when they arrive . other than the size issue they were just as pictured/expected ."
__label__0 "billowy top - perfect for casual comfort . the topic is definitely not raspberry -- it is a sunset orange . disappointed as i was going for a match . i should have gone off of the picture and not the color name ."
__label__0 "i loved this sweater when i bought it . wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag . it shrunk at least two sizes ! and the tassels got all tangled ( which i guess i should have seen coming ) . pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on ."
__label__1 "i feel really cool wearing this skirt : - ) a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform . loooks great with short boots . i 'm wearing it as i write this review -- and was wearing it all day . awesome skirt !"
__label__1 "i absolutely love these shorts ! they are the perfect length too . i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years . it 's hard to find shorts that are n't super short yet are n't bermuda and are still flattering . i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section . rolls are not sewn on both ends so you 'll have to re-roll each wash. wish you carried these basics at all times ."
__label__1 "this is a beautiful well made jacket . also it 's very cozy and warm . unfortunately for me it was too short and wide . i ordered the petite but it was still too wide which also made it look too short . not flattering for my small frame ."
__label__0 "this top is for someone flat chested and skinny . i really like the styling color fabric and everything except that it 's not for my body type . i am a 36dd and have a little bit of a stomach ... so it makes me look fat from the sides . the pictures taken on the model are from the front and back - but i will bet she would still look good in it from the sides ! will be returning it ."
__label__-1 "this shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips . the fit at the top is tight ( i ordered a small ) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller ( i am 5 ' 7 ) it hits at a place that is not flattering . i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings . this is not it ... also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting ."
__label__0 "i thought i might like the look of this oversized odette dress but after i tried it on i felt it was not a flattering style on me . the color was pretty and fabric was nice - just not a fit for me ."
__label__0 "this shirt is cute . i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine while still casual . it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely . the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center . i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around . i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying ."
__label__1 "this is beautiful . it can serve as a sweater or a coat and i ca n't wait to start wearing it ."
__label__0 "i was expecting an ivory/white cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit . i am 138 lbs 36b and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m. the sweater is at least 1 or 2 sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fit . the lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them . also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes . not unpleasant but not as pictured . as"

__label__0 "these ran true to size but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving . i 'm athletic and have lean legs but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh . and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric . i loved how they fit at the waist but the legs just did n't work for me . sadly returning these ."
__label__0 "it looks great on the model but not on me . on me it looked more like a sack of potatoes . the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion . it is very thick . i 'll be returning it because it is not flattering on me ."

__label__-1 "i had high hopes with the other positive reviews but it did n't work on me . nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and did n't lay well and did n't do my bust any favors . maybe better on those less pear shaped . hopeless on me ."
__label__-1 "i was excited to receive this top . it looked great online vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves . when i tried it on the fabric looked and felt cheap . it is not a flowy top . do not recommend it ."

__label__0 "online this dress looks so perfect but in person it 's a bit dowdy and unflattering at least on me . i 'm a size 4 with curves and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure . but sadly it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt so it just did nothing for me . i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit but the skirt still has too much fabric making my hips look large . so much potential but missed the mark for me ."
__label__1 "i love this sweater . it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe . i live in minnesota so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential . this sweater fits the bill . i love how soft and warm it is the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional ( warm and cozy ) . i love anything with pockets which this has . i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short . i did not find that to be true for me and i ordere"

__label__-1 "i am 5 ' 2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially . another reviewer said this was more like a shift and she was right . not worth the price on sale ."

__label__0 "i love maeve dresses but there are several issues with this one ( for my taste ) . 1 ) the fabric and color closely resembles my medical scrubs 2 ) the zipper is cheap and barely goes up or down even when it 's just on the hanger . 3 ) the bow is really cute but does n't make up for the other shortcomings ."
__label__0 "i ordered this in blue and loved the color . i 'm not typically into the flowing top style but i tried a few items on my last order this being one . it 's unseamed at the bottom which was my primary reason for returning it - i could n't see that in the photo online - but if that is your style this item is good quality soft comfortable material and a great spring or fall blue ."
__label__1 "this jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer ! unique and absolutely beautiful . i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller . hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece . i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket ."

__label__0 "i agree with some of the other reviewers ; this dress runs very large . when i tried on the xs in my local store i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home it was just too roomy and not fitted enough . i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better . it is an adoreable design cut and color . it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it ."
__label__0 "this is beautiful fabric and a good fit but it 's such a pain to get on and off that i just do n't want to hassle with it . the button is in the back and very tricky to reach . too bad because otherwise it 's darling !"
__label__1 "this is a beautiful top however my top did not match the one in the picture it 's so odd the stripes are completely different it 's ok because it 's very pretty but i do like the one pictured better . it 's too short on me for leggings and boots but it 's great with skinny jeans . very pretty and soft material ."
__label__0 "as with many of retailer 's tops these days there is a lot of fabric on this tee . it hangs fairly well though . the white color is cream which did n't work for me but is n't bad . a little sheer but wearable with a nude bra . if you have a thinnish upper body order down a size !"
__label__-1 "i would n't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75 % less . they are so cheaply constructed . one wash and they 're all but guaranteed to shrink . the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer . they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them ."
__label__1 "this sweater/coat is great . it super comfortable . it 's perfect for my california winters ! it could be layered for colder areas . this piece definitely runs large- like really large . i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium . it is meant to be boxy and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering . i 'd definitely say go in store and try it on you 'll love it !"

__label__1 "i already have some dresses similar to this but i could n't help getting this one too . i love the flowers bees and ladybugs on the print ! there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots . i think i can wear this at work with the right cardigan/jacket so i 'll get more use out of it . it 's a lovely light floaty fabric that 's nice for warmer weather ."
__label__-1 "this dress is beautiful and extremely well made ... if you can get into it . the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back . it 's form fitting so you 'd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand . i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper but it 's soooo form fitting i 'm afraid i would n't wear it ."
__label__0 "so this is still a pretty cute shirt but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt . it does n't seem to be defective just a different version of the shirt . i 'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have . still deciding whether to keep or not . no more left in xs to place another order and see what 's up . i do wish it had the ruffle in front as that is what caught my eye ."
__label__-1 "this tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole . first of all the armhole is way too low ! second there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm . since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem . no need for the side zipper it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side ."
__label__-1 "this top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly ."
__label__-1 "i loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body . it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections . bottom of pants are not hemmed so if you want a clean look you may not like the edges . these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me ."

__label__1 "i initially ordered a small but found it looked way more oversized then what it should look like even considering the style . ( i was swimming in fabric ! ) i exchanged it for a petite small and it fit perfectly . it goes so well with so many looks and it is going to last a long while in my rotation . looks much better in person too . my only reservation is that unlike the original one i received this one had many threads loose throughout which i clipped and think will be alright but i expected"
__label__0 "i am on the fence about this one . the length is great . it hits right above my knee at 5 ' 1 . overall it was larger than i was hoping . the waist is pretty loose and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit . the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide . i wish they had it in a petite size . for this price i will probably return it . it 's not worth the 300 price tag ."
__label__-1 "i ordered a size small . i am 5 ' 7 size 6 and the dress was a mini on me ! way shorter than on the taller model . the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high so the dress was both too small and too big ! very odd fit . the material is soft thick stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked . this one is going back ."
__label__-1 "i love the colors . however $ 200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric no lining what so ever . the fabric is very thin . you will need a slip . looks just like a cover-up . going back ."
__label__1 "this dress is very versatile and i plan to use in all year round with some tights and boots in the fall/winter and strappy sandals in spring/summer . i originally purchased this dress in a m but had to size down for a more snug and flattering fit . the navy is much darker than the picture ."
__label__1 "i originally purchased a small after reading some of the reviews . although it did fit i felt it was just slightly snug across the chest and upper arms . i returned for a medium ( my usual size ) and it was perfect . it had the same look and flow as what you see in the model pics . i love love love that it is long-sleeved and has pockets ! ! ! ! ! i went ahead and ordered the other print as well ! i wore the first one to work with some knee high boots and got many compliments . highly recommend !"

__label__1 "i really wanted to like this dress on me but it was not to be . the color is one of my favorites but the dress accented all my problem areas . sadly i returned it . i 'm sure that someone with less substantial hips will look great in it ."
__label__-1 "i wish this shirt would not have had so much material . it would make a great maternity top ! if you are really thin it might work for you too ."
__label__0 "i really really wanted to take this home with me but decided against it . from the front this dress looks amazing when it was belted and i love the colors in it . however it bunched like crazy in the back . i tried it without the belting and it just hung like a sack and was completely unflattering . if there were some way to get rid of the bunching in the back then i would have taken it home . but with the cost of the dress i ca n't justify taking it to a tailor so it stayed . sigh . so close ."
__label__1 "i really likes these jeans . they are comfortable with stretch and look cute . the price is high but an investment for sure !"
__label__1 "i own another pair of this brand and these are just as cute and fit the same . i wish the fabric was a bit nice but they still are super cute . they have wider leg holes which are flattering on my muscular build . nice and lightweight and sooooo comfy !"
__label__-1 "i should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering . unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off . i love uniquely shaped wraps like this but this one did n't make the cut for me ."
__label__-1 "this is quite an odd dress . it does wrap and is beautiful material . however the dress does not close at all in the chest area . i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono . it will go back for sure ."
__label__1 "this dress is very figure flattering . however it is not navy it 's purple . overall nice print somewhat cheap material and zipper gets stuck . i am keeping because it 's versatile and i like the vintage floral pattern ."
__label__1 "maeve does not disappoint ! unlike many of the tops and dresses which recently have been billowy a bit shapeless and not form-fitting this hugs all the right curves . it 's adorable eye-catching and the pattern is so cute . i paired it with nude heels today and a jacket - so fun . just like the wynwood top in all 4 colors the level of fun and playfulness is unmatched . it 's tts . i am 5 ' 4 115 and got the 2. thank you retailer & thank you maeve !"
__label__0 "the minute i put this on i knew it was wrong . firstly the neck was quite tight and i had to untie the side tie . secondly as i stood looking in the mirror the dress simply read nightgown . it was frumpy and too long on me . so back it went ."
__label__0 "i bought this dress in a regular xs . i am 5 ' 3 and 108 pounds . i have a long torso so the regular would fit better than the petite . although the overall fit of the dress was good the straps could have had about an inch taken out and the pockets gaped open ! in the photo the mode 's arms are laying over where the pockets would be which fall on the seam and when i tried this on the dress fit beautifully but the pockets gape open on the sides and it looks like little wings from the front . the dre"

__label__1 "button down shirts usually are n't my thing but the soft fabric of this top makes it feminine and comfortable while still keeping that classic look . it 's also easy to dress up or down which is great ! i am 5 ' 4 and small-framed and the size 0 fits just right ."
__label__0 "i like how this jacket is very versatile . you can wear it to work or play . it does have interesting detail on it i kept it based on the price and those details . i have the olive color . the arms are a little tight ."
__label__0 "i agree the light colored portion of dress is not vanilla ; it is more beige color . i liked the dress a lot it had a flattering fit on me extremely comfortable and then i noticed the black mesh portion at top of dress . it did not lay flat at the outer sides between the mesh and floral fabrics like the picture . it poked out on both sides at least 1 which suddenly made the dress look cheap and ill fitting . i can guess either the mesh pattern piece was not cut correctly or it was not sewn correct"
__label__0 "i stalked this blouse and when the price dropped i pounced on the black . sadly it did nothing for me . i 'm a large sometimes medium but decided on the large . you 'd think it came with its own cami at this price but no . completely sheer . unwearable without one . the lace is nothing special . the collar is wider in the back uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front . the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back . i 'm returning this one ."
__label__0 "when you buy a dress full price and it goes on sale before you can even wear it ( $ 168 down to $ 49 ) uuuuggghhh ... i like the dress fine enough but it has a weird under wire it makes my chest look strange like i do n't fill it in . i usually do n't have that problem as a c cup . more orange/red then yellow as well . would n't recommend ."
__label__-1 "i love the coh fleetwood jeans and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans i thought these would be great . but unlike the fleetwoods which are a substantial weight denim these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes . the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering . maybe if you 're looking for jeans you can lounge in these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats ."
__label__1 "i 've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one ! ! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size ( small ) . i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store . it 's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it . you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings ."

__label__1 "this is definitely my go to top for work weekends or night out with the husband . i 've worn it with skinny jeans black tights and skirts . it goes with just about anything . easy to accessorize with a simple long chain necklace or a statement piece . i think the gray combo was a bit more flattering than the green combo ."
__label__0 "i did n't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i 'm not really liking it . it 's the rough unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well rough around the edges . it 's a nicely cut great fitting sweater though so i 'll be looking for some scarves !"
__label__0 "i loved the design of these pants and got them to go with the matching jacket . the problem with them is there is n't enough stretch to keep them up . i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up as they would slide down . the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist ."
__label__0 "beautiful and good quality dress . the pictures nor the description really show or mention the keyhole cut at the front neckline . you really have to look very closely at the model photos to see it . unlike the model i have curves and this dress showed way too much cleavage for me ."
__label__1 "loved this dress but ran much larger than other maeve dresses i have ordered in the past !"
__label__0 "cute details but not happy with the fit . runs wide and short . the peplum fabric on bottom is stiff wrinkles easily and lays funny . returning this one ."
__label__1 "while the blue color pictured is stunning i purchased the white poplin in store . two best features ? the ruffle on the neckline continues across the back and dips into a small v ( a great detail especially for short or swept-up hair during summer months ) . next this white fabric 's crisp finish is coupled with a just right weight ( solid enough to be opaque but light enough for warm days ) . plan to pair it with skinny jeans throughout spring and summer . thrilled !"

__label__-1 "the colors in this dress are beautiful ( the green/blue version ) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy . i purchased it online and was n't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown i really wanted to love it but it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "do not buy ! i used my 15 % discount on this . what a waste . my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand . i should have gotten a small . i do n't think that would 've helped . it was so awkward looking . nothing like the model . it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds . it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet . the material was really thick . it is more appropriate for fall . i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down . it was just so ridiculous ."
__label__0 "i 'm all over this trend but this vest is quite thick/poufy and on me i feel like it triangles out and all you see is furball . i love it - but i think you need some height for this to look its best . on me a sweater vest would perhaps be better . i am chesty . but i cant decide . its really cute ! if you 're taller than 5 ' 4 do n't hesitate ."

( 5ft ) i think this is versatile enough to wear to work party or a casual wedding . the fit is perfect - hugs at the correct spots . the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely . overall - i love it ."

__label__0 "frustrated that the details do n't mention there 's a side zip . for whatever reason i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it 's a pull-on style when that 's not the case . there 's also no give in the waist . besides the fit not working for me it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on ."
__label__-1 "oh such a classic retailer look for summer ! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric . i was immediately drawn to it . but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist creating the look of an apron . yes . it looks like one is wearing a full apron . or scrub dress . why ? ? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo ."
__label__0 "this top runs small across the top . i was amazed at the material -- polyester i am sure -- because the price was so high . it has a sheer layer underneath which i think would make it hot in the summer . i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online ."

__label__-1 "in a sea of dresses this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store . i am a pear shape and ended up trying both the medium and the large taking the medium home . it was super flattering on and was an appropriate length to pair with tights . here 's where the problem happened . i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving i put it on and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip ! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband . so disappointed ."
__label__-1 "given that i am petite with thighs ( take a size 6p or 28p ) these were not for me ! the run small are really tight from the thigh up run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin . on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient . i was looking for something i could wear to work and these were not the right style for that . plus they seemed cheaply made like they would n't stand the test of time . i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model they would look good"

__label__-1 "it just is n't that flattering on me . it looks kind of old and dingy even though it 's brand new . it fits fine but does n't do much to highlight my curves . it just kind of hangs there . the length is somewhat awkward ( i bought the petite version ) . maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny like the model . it 's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front which reminded me of maternity wear . it does appear to be pretty well made ; top part is lined . overall it 's not terrible"
