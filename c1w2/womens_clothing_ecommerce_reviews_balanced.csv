-1,This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot  it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.,Blouses
-1,Loved the fit and colors  but the fabric is very thin and see-thru. i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible. it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to.,Blouses
-1,The shape is awkward  too loose  not flattering. my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasn't as cute as online. returning this one.,Blouses
-1,"This top is a joke unless you are really into expensive clown wear. i thought this looked whimsical  fun and a well-designed piece when i saw it on line--especially at this high price. i started to laugh before i even pulled the entire top of out the bag when i got it in the mail today. it is not expensive looking at all  and the pom poms look like a sad craft project rather than a special detail. it is a bit juvenile too. even if you wore it and were going for ""ironic""  it would be difficult to",Blouses
-1,I love the idea of this shirt  but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off  but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br,Blouses

-1,Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately  none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;),Blouses
-1,This top is huge! i'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge. it's wider than it is long. even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric. i'm so disappointed! beautiful color and fabric but there's so much fabric. i love a flowy top but this one is way too much. :( i will be returning this top.,Blouses
-1,"I love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended. not so. for starters the top is much more of a beige in person. a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully. secondly there is just so. much. fabric. it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like i've tried to hard to make it ""work""  lastly the",Blouses

0,Saw this on the mannequin and tried it on just for kicks:  ________  pros:  - breathable fabric  all cotton  with a lovely color.  ________  cons:  - runs large  which is the style of the top anyhow. however  i was swimming in the medium (and i normally fit in size 10/12 or m/l tops with retailer stuff. you can easily size down and have plenty of room left. but if you like it really baggy  then stick with your normal size. for reference  i'm a 36c and hourglass and had ample room in a medium.  - s,Blouses
0,I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful  but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short  but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it  i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size  and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still,Blouses
0,"I really wanted to love this. sadly  the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly  it's see through! a top like this looses it's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally  good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the ""poor man's pineapple top."" i couldn't agree more  sigh. i really did want",Blouses

0,I really wanted to love this top when i got it  but not so much. it fit nicely through the bust and torso  but flared out way too much  it ended up looking like a maternity top. maybe because i am more of an hourglass shape. another thing  it was very low cut  i would not have been able to wear this without a cami underneath. the fabric didn't seem to be the best quality  it also had a funny smell too it when i took it out of the package. this shirt was not worth the price. sadly  this was a mis,Blouses
0,"This top looks adorable in the product photos  so i had high hopes. i think i might be too short to pull it off  but like another reviewer said  i found it to be like a tent on me  billowing out in all directions. it was just overall too big on me--i even considered whether i could wear it as a dress  but the sleeves were also too billowy on me. i am 5'4""  120 lbs and tried the xs.",Blouses
0,I'm pretty tan and i always have to be careful with white tops or pants. i love the embroidery detail but this top is practically see-through for me. it is double-lined  but i could still see my bra. very pretty though and i was disappointed that it didn't work for me.,Blouses
0,The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders  but that was kind of snug  perhaps why it didn't fit right  it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose  so it looked big on me  but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big  so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!    colors are nice  light  but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri,Blouses

1,Darling top  lovely dark rich raspberry red color. runs very large so definitely size down. i ordered the s and m. i am usually m but went with the small. the s was smaller in the shoulders of course but not terribly- it was only an issue when i hugged myself. in the picture it looks like it fits her very well. i don't feel like it fits me quite as well- it's borderline maternity-ish... just a little too large and should come in at the waist just a touch more. i agree the bow i.e. seems weak (fa,Blouses

1,I bought the grey and white plaid shirt in a large. i'm 165  36d and the top closes without gaping - even when i push my shoulders back. it's kind of sheer  so will wear a cami underneath. the waist nips in right where it should - giving a trim silhouette. adorable and fun top  without being cutesy. love tylho tops!,Blouses

-1,Retailer has incredible service  and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however  this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use  so i first tried hand washing it. however  the black part of the dress came off on the white part  making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful  striking dress (that would be great maternit,Dresses
-1,I saw this dress and loved everything about it! i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big. they were out of the smaller size  so i had to return it. the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture.,Dresses
-1,This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that's about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.,Dresses
-1,I wanted to love this dress. the cut  fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it  but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off  it is over-priced for the cheap,Dresses
-1,I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail  i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online  the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat  i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!,Dresses
-1,I got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it. the color is a beautiful rich red  which was a nice surprise. i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture. love the fabric - soft and appears to be good quality. the length is perfect - hit right at my knees (size small). the flow of the dress is great as well. the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes. the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck - almost like it was on,Dresses

0,I love  love  love this absolutely stunning dress. the only problem was that the zipper was very difficult to maneuver  and when it finally went up  the watch it was attached the lining of the dress made a bump in the dress  which was very unflattering on an otherwise very flattering dress. i tried on multiple versions of this dress and had the same design issue with each. i ended up returning it because it bothered me so much.,Dresses

0,The outer layer runs large up top; also  the orange stitching (the flowers) on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath. i'm returning it because for the price i don't love it.,Dresses
0,I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they're very soft and very well made  hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress.,Dresses
0,I really wanted to love this dress! the quality is great  and the overall look is so lovely. however  i tried two different sizes (petite s and petite xs) and it still looked too baggy/big. the upper part is wider than it appears. also  the photos shows the bottom two buttons buttoned up. however  the dress doesn't actually have any loop holes or button holes  so it just hangs open. very sad to have to return both dresses.,Dresses
0,This is definitely a personal preference review. i loved this dress when i tried it on. it's really beautiful. however  there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me. i know it's the style and i have similar style dresses  but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me.,Dresses

1,Oh how i love this dress! i was worried because i am very busty and sometimes that translated to looking pregnant in swing dresses  but this.... incredible! i am wearing it with either blue strappy sandals or red heels and it is quite the perfect summer dress! the material is thick  and feels elegant  the colors are vibrant. today is my first day wearing it  and i have already received 4 compliments! no kidding! wonderful! maeve clothing... i love you!,Dresses
1,"This dress is a winner! the material is not stiff like many neoprene dresses - it is soft and silky and has amazing drape. the dress is very flattering! the material is very stretchy even through the waist  so it is and easy ""perfect fit"" on different body types. i loved the shorter versions of the dress  but they weren't workable for me  but this length is perfect. and there are pockets that are sewn in with perfect detailing - they don't stick out or disturb the line of the dress.",Dresses

-1,I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt  but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight  which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.,Fine gauge

-1,I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.,Fine gauge

0,I have a mixed feeling about this cardigan.  on one hand  i like it; on the other hand  there are some minor things i do not like.  first  i love its knit pattern; especially the pattern on the back.  second  i like a soft color of this cardigan.  on website pictures  two motifs look almost the same.  in reality  brown motif is light pink-ish while blue motif is light blue-green-ish.  third  texture.  this cardigan is made of linen and cotton  so it feels comfortable to wear.  if there are flaws,Fine gauge

1,Be aware that this cardigan runs small- as you can see on the model  it's a form-fitting style. it's not the kind of cardigan you would unbutton and take on and off as a layering piece. i would wear it more like a top with a button-up front. it is nice and soft and the black and white scalloped design is attractive. i would recommend it if you are looking for a more fitted top with this design. i'm not wow-ed by it  but it's nice in a 50's kind of way.,Fine gauge

-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates

0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates

0,This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
1,This bra is beautiful. the lace is so lovely and soft and looks fabulous on. my only criticism is it runs very small. i am a 32 a and order the size 1 and it is snug... just order a size up (or two) and it should be perfect.,Intimates
1,Runs large  but very beautiful and sexy! the straps are elastic so better to size down.,Intimates
1,Yes  this is a thinner bra  it's almost sheer when you hold it up to the light  but it fit perfectly (36d) and is seamless under even the thinnest tops. i love that its not padded  i feel like it just slightly enhances my natural shape without adding anything more  and i really wish i had bought multiples before they sold out! i can't speak to how it will hold up since i just got it yesterday and i'm wearing it for the first time today  but i'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will last as wel,Intimates
1,I found this set once while browsing the website. i fell in love with it and kept a photo of the set so i could save up to purchase it. as luck would have it  my mom surprised me with a gift card  so i applied it to my purchase. i'm so happy with the set. it's wonderfully flattering  and makes me feel sexy. i want one in every color!,Intimates
1,This bra is extremely comfortable and surprisingly supportive considering the lack of padding or firm material. it also runs large.,Intimates
1,I honestly just love the hanky panky brand. i know it sometimes feels a little extravagant to purchase their lingerie  but the quality  fit and style are so good that it is absolutely worth it. this piece is no exception. i don't normally purchase lingerie like this  but saw this chemise and decided to try it. just as the other pieces from this brand  it's comfortable and gorgeous- so high quality and classy. it's a great cut  the fabric is clearly lace  but beautifully done. and the feel is lov,Intimates
1,I am so happy with this chemise! the pink is the most breathtaking blush and the fabric is super soft. i like that the straps are adjustable  allowing me to make the bodice a perfect fit while adjusting the gown to the perfect length for me. it's definitely my new favorite!,Intimates
1,Great style and cut  love the deep v. the fabric is soft and its very comfortable. it gives some support. i don't wear it with light blouses or shirts  unless i'm hanging around the house. i have this is pink and black.,Intimates

-1,This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking  the modern and structured style  and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it  and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby  the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref,Jackets
-1,This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews  but it was way too big. sadly  i had to return it.,Jackets
-1,I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't look quite like it does in the photos online. it also runs small. i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price.,Jackets
-1,I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts  length is fine...the inside is some  but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.,Jackets
-1,"This arrived this week and i was so disappointed. the proportions are all wrong--- from the empire waist to the dolman sleeves  to the weird texture added to the material. if i could sum up this jacket with one word it would be ""weird"".",Jackets
-1,I ordered this vest in xxs  since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then  the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big  not artfully drapey.,Jackets
-1,"When i saw this jacket in store  i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3"" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc",Jackets

0,I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter  thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing  more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don't think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely.,Jackets

0,Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!,Jackets
0,"I really  really wanted to love this jacket. unfortunately  i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me. it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer. i am 5'6""  but long waisted. this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature. it was beautiful (although the buttons were cheap...)",Jackets

0,I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.,Jackets
0,"This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however  is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3"" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the",Jackets

1,Received this jacket today and i am so very impressed with the details. initially when i ordered this jacket i first thought the navy blue waffle fabric was a corduroy or velvet  but it is a plain cotton blended fabric with unfinished edges that has the denim attached to it. the plus is the inside breast pocket that is trimmed so nicely and lined  and fits a nice sized phone. the inside is lined and even the sleeves are lined . there is pretty cream lace trim on the inside bottom of the lining i,Jackets

1,I would have never purchased this jacket based on the photo displayed here. it looks like something my grandma would wear. in person  however  this jacket is so versatile. the fabric moves with your body and the ties at the bottom in the back and inside at the waist can be cinched to give it the look you want. i purchased this to wear with the weekend widelegs (which i also adore)  and it's absolutely perfect. color goes with everything. i'll wear it with boyfriend jeans in the fall  too. great,Jackets
1,This vest kept catching my eye online. i was ordering moth cashmere cowlneck sweater  (which is fabulous ) when i noticed pictures posted of women wearing both the vest & sweater. the more i looked at these pictures  the more i fell in love with the vest. needless to say  i purchased the vest in my usual size xs which fits tts. it's incredibly soft & a great piece to add to your wardrobe!,Jackets
1,I tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it. the picture does not do it justice. it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality. fabric is very soft and light weight. highly recommend!,Jackets
1,Love it! easy to wear  true to size. there is a slight texture which makes it very cozy,Jackets
1,I purchased this in purple  and agree with previous reviewers who've mentioned that it looks more casual in person. it can be dressed up with the right accessories  though  and the fabric is really excellent quality  soft and durable. i really like the contrasting plaid back  it's a subtle but fashionable detail.,Jackets
1,This jacket is surprisingly soft and comfy. i'd been debating getting a leather jacket in this style but when i saw this it seemed a great option. seems to be very versatile.,Jackets
-1,The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.,Jeans
-1,I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair  the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong  but those were even worse. they looked obscene.,Jeans
-1,So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews  they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly  too. there are weird fading marks all over  even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely,Jeans
-1,These ag stevie ankle jeans only have 50% cotton.tthe rest is 41% lyocell (a rayon)  7% polyester  and 2% polyurethane. result: thin and clingy jeans that show every lump  and stretch out.   .  these are no longer the same lovely ags in twill when they were at 80% cotton  18% modal  2% pu. it seems ag has also stopped making denim and corduroy with 98% cotton  at least in the stevies.  .  i'm sure these will be a great choice for someone looking for very soft and thin pants that feel like pjs  b,Jeans
-1,These were perfect in the legs  nice and stretchy  but problematic in the waist. i'm generally a 31/size 12  but i had to squeeze to get them to close. they've already gone back. if you have a tinier waist they'd probably be fine.,Jeans
-1,I absolutely love mother jeans  but i unfortunately had to return these ones. this particular style seemed to run pretty small. too  i always size up in white jeans  and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight. i typically wear a 28 in mother  and ordered a 29 in these.,Jeans
-1,I ordered first the green  then the grey (in case the green was mismarked.)  so short!!  is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend??  anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them. but there is no way to lengthen them.  i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years. they are a full 2 1/2 inches shorter! wow!  note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the model's ankle. that's how they are in real life.  i wear these pants in a tall  and live,Jeans
-1,Where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go??? these are a cheap impersonator. the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half. the last 3 pairs of pilcro stets i've ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally. the pockets on these jeans sit so so low- completely unflattering. the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially. the old stet ankle jeans ha,Jeans

0,Ordered these in 31p last year  prob could have worn a 30p  ordered 30p and 31p this year. the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy. this year neither size fit.   this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit. it's the waist that doesn't work for me. if you're curvier this is probably a good fit change.,Jeans

0,I am a huge fan of pilcro pants  and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants. the idea is great - leather in the front  fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look. however  i couldn't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around (can't bend the leg all the way; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee). the fit was perfect everywhere else. sadly  these had to go back :(,Jeans
0,I have been looking for flares that are not tight through the thigh and these are definitely them...but for me they were so long that to hem them would ruin the style of the pants. i'm 5'5 and have long legs but i would need a high heel to maintain the intended style  and that's not what i was looking for. otherwise  beautiful.,Jeans

0,I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle  so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198  in my opinion.,Jeans

1,"I originally purchased these in a size 27 and they were big. i returned them and got a size 26  and they did stretch out after wearing them once - to the point where i could probably have gone done to a size 25. the cut  color  fabric and distressing are great. i am 5'3"" and the pants are a tad too long for me to wear them with ankle booties without looking odd. overall  i love these jeans and wear them a lot!",Jeans
1,These pants are great  as is the case with most c of h jeans.  they are a perfect length if you are 5&#39;5&quot; or shorter (i.e. you don&#39;t need to cuff them several times).  i love the relaxed but chic look.  they run large so definitely size down at least one size.  so happy they were on sale!,Jeans
1,I really can't say enough about them. they have the perfect amount of stretch  are so comfortable and they keep their shape really well. i would say that you could wear them 3 times before washing. also  the color is perfect. they are tts and even allow for a little extra holiday weight without becoming a torture device.,Jeans
1,When these cords went on sale i bought a 2nd pair. they are great work week pants (i teach) - comfortable and machine washable. the fit is relaxed-trouser,Jeans
1,For those of you that don't care for stretch jeans you would probably like these. they feel like 100% cotton but better. no stretch at all which i'm glad. i'm not a fan of the stretch. to me these are those comfy go-to jeans. i got my usual size 28 which i perfer in these because i can use the pockets with ease. the pockets are lower side pocket which are great! you will likely need to hem them unless you are pretty tall. i hemmed mine and you can't tell it. i'm not sure how much these could be,Jeans
1,I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular petite size 27 (27-35-116lbs) as that's the size i almost always order but ended up exchanging them for the next size up and found the 28's to feel much more comfortable so i'd suggest sizing up one size. the jeans run a bit tight in the thigh and waist area and though i could also get away with wearing the 27's  i just personally prefer the fit of the 28's better. these jeans give a nice shape in the back  are super soft and are the same color,Jeans
1,Love the fit and comfort of these jeans!!! better than my 7's and citizens. the distressing is perfect  i don't have to worry about enlarging a knee hole. like another reviewer noted the color is lighter in person. they fit true to size for me and kept their shape a 3 wears. wish a knew about these before!!,Jeans
1,I love ag stevie cords! i'm 5'4 and pear-shaped and the 26p fit great  the length and mid-rise are perfect! very comfortable and can be dressed up for casual work environment or down for weekend. the material is a bit thinner and not as soft as versions from previous years but still very nice and perhaps more versatile. wish petite had more color options.,Jeans

0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.,Layering

0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

1,Love this top! i'm 5'7  145 pounds  athletic build  and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut  so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment  but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back  as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality  and i would order this in more colors if it were available!,Layering

0,These sleep pants are very pretty  soft and comfortable. unfortunately  after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price. i don't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i'm not so sure. i guess if you don't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what's the point of buying them?,Lounge

-1,Unfortunately  this sweater let me down! i love retailer  especially their sweaters  but this one fell flat. it was tight on the arms  and didn't hang well on my body. it was odd in length and added about 20lb to my frame. i kept it because i wanted to force it to work  alas  i just donated it. hopefully it fits someone else better than me..,Sweaters

1,First saw this poncho on a petite blog and after reading reviews happily paid full price. i followed the petite reviews and purchased the xs regular. the length hits right below my bum so it's perfectly structured to wear with leggings. the cable knit is super soft and very warm. wore this for the first time last weekend layered over a long sleeve tee and was perfectly cozy outside for a fall day in chicago. this item will not last long and is well worth paying full price.,Sweaters
